# Recent Emergence of Bd in Africa
This repository holds analytic code used in preparing the "Continent-wide recent emergence of a global pathogen in African amphibians" publication by Ghose et al. (2023; Frontiers in Conservation Science)

The repository consists of:

Scripts on pulling, preparing, cleaning up, and extracting data
Bioclimactic and anthropogenic data from rasters provided by WorldClim and Venter et al. (2016); respectively
Historical weather data from Oregon State University's PRISM program
Hydrography data from U.S. Geological Survey's National Hydrography Dataset (NHD)
Scripts on checking assumptions required for modeling and for performing both the MCMC Bayesian model of pathogen arrival and the logistic regression included in the paper

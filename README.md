# Recent Emergence of Bd in Africa
This repository holds analytic code used in preparing the "Continent-wide recent emergence of a global pathogen in African amphibians" publication by Ghose et al. (2023; Frontiers in Conservation Science)

### The repository consists of:
- Scripts on pulling, preparing, cleaning up, and extracting bioclimactic and anthropogenic data from rasters provided by WorldClim and Venter et al. (2016); respectively
- Scripts on checking assumptions required for modeling, generating PCA, and for performing both the MCMC Bayesian model of pathogen arrival and the logistic regression included in the paper
